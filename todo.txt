To Do:
Enhance the stats/warning page with ajax dropdown goodness.
Validation!!
close down all outstanding bugs
new schema scripts - MySQL, Postgres, Derby and Oracle
Make a Derby/Tomcat package
Make a test data package for MySQL
Soak testing

Completed:
Clear trend data option - done!
Assess Hibernate 4 - implemented - required Spring 3.1 and a bit of faffing but i'm happy with it.
URL builder - sort of done.
Remove jquery grid - display tag - done
change password feature - done
Rethink dashboard toolbar - done - looks loads better - might use that style else where for adds
Caching and performance.

Postponed:
Parameters populate field from the burst query - putting on back burner as this is going to be hard hard
Upgrade quartz to 2.1 - can't be done without refactoring loads of stuff as it is not supported by spring - went to 1.8.6 instead - to be tested - seems OK
