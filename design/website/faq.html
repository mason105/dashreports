							<h3>
								<a href="#">Why should I use Dash Reports over &quot;X&quot;
									reporting solution?</a>
							</h3>
							<article>
							<p>Dash Reports started as a utility to run simple SQL
								queries and produce output. Then the requirements increased to
								support other functions such as parameter and output bursting,
								security, dashboards and it just grew organically from there.</p>
							<p>It offers a few things in one place that other packages
								don't, hence why I wrote it. It also offers all the features by
								default, no Enterprise Edition or Pro Version - everything is
								included. In simple terms, it offers a lot for no cash.</p>
							</article>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h3>
								<a href="#">How do I write the SQL for the reports and
									dashboards?</a>
							</h3>
							<article>
							<p>Queries in Dash Reports are just raw SQL, with the
								exception of parameters in the reports. I'd recommend using a
								3rd party package in which to develop the SQL.</p>
							<p>Currently Dash Reports does not have a query builder. I
								thought that it is best to leave that to the tools that come
								with the various RDBMS - e.g. SQL Developer for Oracle or MySQL
								Workbench. Any query builder I wrote would be no where near as
								powerful as they are. However if there is enough demand I'll
								have a go at writing one.</p>
							</article>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h3>
								<a href="#">What is Report Runner?</a>
							</h3>
							<article>
							<p>Report Runner was the original name of the product.
								However I realised that someone else was using the name for
								something related so I decided to change the name. The
								references are still in the code and some configuration, as it
								is not really worth the effort to expunge it entirely.</p>
							</article>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h3>
								<a href="#">Can I integrate the login/security into my
									authentication manager?</a>
							</h3>
							<article>
							<p>Currently it is not configurable. However - Dash Reports
								uses Spring Security, so if you are able to configure it via the
								security-context.xml, then it should be possible. I might
								document this, if there is enough request.</p>
							</article>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h3>
								<a href="#">Does it support High Availability Configuration?</a>
							</h3>
							<article>
							<p>Simply, yes. I will document the process for creating a
								clustered deployment using Tomcat, MySQL and Apache HTTPd.</p>
							</article>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h3>
								<a href="#">Don't the constant refreshes of dashboards
									hammer my datasources?</a>
							</h3>
							<article>
							<p>When a user views a dashboard they are viewing data cached
								in the Dash Reports database. This data is refreshed at
								intervals defined by the creator of the dashboard item. When the
								dashboard item refreshes it copies the data into the dashreports
								database, therefore allowing multiple users to view the data
								with only one call on the source data.</p>
							<p>In addition, there is a lot of caching go on interally
								within Dash Reports to further reduce load on the Dash Reports
								database.</p>
							</article>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h3>
								<a href="#">How are the passwords of the datasources and
									users protected?</a>
							</h3>
							<article>
							<p>The user passwords are one-way hashed and subsequently
								unrecoverable (without brute-force).</p>
							<p>Datasource passwords are encrypted under 3-DES. The key is
								stored in the server's properties file, not in the database -
								separating the concerns of encrypted data storage and the
								encryption key into different layers of the system. The key can
								be regenerated and the passwords re-encrypted via a UI function;
								this also requires editing the properties file.</p>
							<p>To compromise the datasource passwords, the attacker would
								need to compromise both the server running Dash Reports and the
								database hosting it's data. It is therefore highly recommended
								that they are on separate machines/OS zones.</p>

							<h3>
								<a href="#">What is the quickest route to Mordor?</a>
							</h3>
							<article>
							<p>One does not simply walk into Mordor!</p>
							</article>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h3>
								<a href="#">Is it possible to template the report output?</a>
							</h3>
							<article>
							<p>Yes! Jasper Reports is supported. Simply upload a JRXML
								file when editing the report definition and select Jasper as the
								template type. The JRXML needs to reference the fields as they
								are named in the SQL. The result set from Dash Reports executing
								the report's SQL will be injected into the Jasper renderer.</p>
