						<div>
							<h3>
								<a href="#"><strong>Why should I use Dash Reports over &quot;X&quot; reporting solution?</strong></a>
							</h3>
							<div>
							<p>Dash Reports started as a utility to run simple SQL queries and produce output.  Then the requirements increased to support other functions such as parameter and output bursting, security, dashboards and it just grew organically from there.</p>
							<p>It offers a few things in one place that other packages don't, hence why I wrote it.  It also offers all the features by default, no Enterprise Edition or Pro Version - everything is included.  In simple terms, it offers a lot for no cash.</p>												
							</div>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h3>
								<a href="#"><strong>How do I write the SQL for the reports and dashboards?</strong></a>
							</h3>
							<div>
							<p>Queries in Dash Reports are just raw SQL, with the exception of parameters in the reports.  I'd recommend using a 3rd party package in which to develop the SQL.</p>
							<p>Currently Dash Reports does not have a query builder.  I thought that it is best to leave that to the tools that come with the various RDBMS - e.g. SQL Developer for Oracle or MySQL Workbench.  Any query builder I wrote would be no where near as powerful as they are.  However if there is enough demand I'll have a go at writing one.</p>							
							</div>
						</div>

							<h3>
								<a href="#"><strong>What is Report Runner?</strong></a>
							</h3>
							<div>Report Runner was the original name of the product.  However I realised that someone else was using the name for something related so I decided to change the name.  The references are still in the code and some configuration, as it is not really worth the effort to expunge it entirely.</div>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h3>
								<a href="#"><strong>Can I integrate the login/security into my authentication manager?</strong></a>
							</h3>
							<div>Currently it is not configurable.  However - Dash Reports uses Spring Security, so if you are able to configure it via the security-context.xml, then it should be possible.  I might document this, if there is enough request</div>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h3>
								<a href="#"><strong>Does it support High Availability Configuration?</strong></a>
							</h3>
							<div>Simply, yes.  I will document the process for creating a clustered deployment using Tomcat, MySQL and Apache HTTPd</div>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h3>
								<a href="#"><strong>Don't the constant refreshes of dashboards hammer my datasources?</strong></a>
							</h3>
							<div><p>When a user views a dashboard they are viewing data cached in the Dash Reports database.  This data is refreshed at intervals defined by the creator of the dashboard item.  When the dashboard item refreshes it copies the data into the dashreports database, therefore allowing multiple users to view the data with only one call on the source data.</p>
							<p>In addition, there is a lot of caching go on interally within Dash Reports to further reduce load on the Dash Reports database.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h3>
								<a href="#"><strong>How are the passwords of the datasources and users protected??</strong></a>
							</h3>
							<div><p>The user passwords are one-way hashed and therefore unrecoverable (without brute-force).</p>
							<p>Datasource passwords are encrypted under 3-DES.  The key is stored in the server's properties file, not in the database - therefore separating the concerns of encrypted data storage and the encryption key into different layers of the system.  The key can be regenerated and the passwords re-encrypted via a UI function; this also requires editing the properties file.</p><p>  To compromise the datasource passwords, the attacker would need to compromise both the server running Dash Reports and the database hosting it's data.  Therefore it is highly recommended that they are on separate machines/OS zones.</p>

							<h3>
								<a href="#"><strong>What is the quickest route to Mordor?</strong></a>
							</h3>
							<div>
							<p>One does not simply walk into Mordor!</p>																	
							</div>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h3>
								<a href="#"><strong>Is it possible to template the report output?</strong></a>
							</h3>
							<div>
							<p>Yes!  Jasper Reports is supported.  Simply upload a JRXML file when editing the report definition.  The JRXML needs to reference the fields as their are named in the SQL.  The result set from Dash Reports will be injected into the Jasper renderer.</p>																	
							</div>
