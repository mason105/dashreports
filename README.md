Dash Reports is a lightweight, Java-based reporting and dashboard solution. It supports scheduled invocation of reports, various output formats (PDF, XLS, HTML, RTF, etc.), report formating (via Jasper), chart and data grid based dashboards, and realtime operation. It allows administrators and power users to create reports for day-to-day users to run at their leisure or have delivered by various methods (email, FTP, SFTP, SMB, file system). The dashboard functionality allows administrators to create rich dashboards for their users using the JFreeChart library.
