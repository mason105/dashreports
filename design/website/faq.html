							<h3>
								<a href="#">Why Dash Reports over X?</a>
							</h3>
							<div>
							<p>Dash Reports started as a utility to run simple SQL queries and produce output.  Then the requirement came to support other functions such as parameter and output bursting, security, dashboards and it just grew organically from there.</p>
							<p>It offers a few things in one place that other packages don't, hence why I wrote it.  It also offers all the features by default, no Enterprise Edition or Pro Version - everything is included.  In simple terms, it offers a lot for no cash.</p>												
							</div>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h3>
								<a href="#">How do I write the SQL for the reports and dashboards?</a>
							</h3>
							<div>
							<p>Queries in Dash Reports are just raw SQL, with the exception of parameters in the reports.  I'd recommend using a 3rd party package in which to develop the SQL.</p>
							<p>Currently Dash Reports does not have a query builder.  I thought that it is best to leave that to the tools that come with the various RDBMS - e.g. SQL Developer for Oracle or MySQL Workbench.  Any query builder I wrote would be no where near as powerful as they are.  However if there is enough demand I'll have a go at writing one.</p>							
							</div>
						</div>

							<h3>
								<a href="#">What is Report Runner?</a>
							</h3>
							<div>Report Runner was the original name of the product.  However I realised that someone else was using the name for something related so I decided to change the name.  The references are still in the code and some configuration, as it is not really worth the effort to expunge it entirely.</div>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h3>
								<a href="#">Can I integrate the login/security into my authentication manager?</a>
							</h3>
							<div>Currently it is not configurable.  However - Dash Reports uses Spring Security, so if you are able to configure it via the security-context.xml, then it should be possible.  I might document this, if there is enough request</div>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h3>
								<a href="#">Does it support High Availability Configuration?</a>
							</h3>
							<div>Simply, yes.  I will document the process for creating a clustered deployment using Tomcat, MySQL and Apache HTTPd</div>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h3>
								<a href="#">Don't the constant refreshes of dashboards hammer my datasources?</a>
							</h3>
							<div><p>When a user views a dashboard they are viewing data cached in the Dash Reports database.  This data a refreshed at intervals defined by the creator of the dashboard item.  When the dashboard item refreshes it copies the data into the dashreports database, therefore allowing multiple users to view the data with only one call on the source data.</p>
							<p>In addition, there is a lot of caching go on interally within Dash Reports to further reduce load on the Dash Reports database.</p>
